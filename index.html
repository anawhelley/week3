        <p>Named for the French punch-cutter Claude Garamond, the typeface in its current form has a foggy past. What we now know as Garamond are modern guesses of fonts that were inspired by drawings which were modeled after the punches of Claude Garamond. 
        The original Garamond punches, long slender metal rectangles with individual letterforms carved into the ends, were finely-tuned and perfected during the early to mid 1500’s up until Claude’s death in 1561. After his death, sets of his punches found their way into the hands of foundries and served as inspirations for many different typefaces in addition to the many variations of Garamond. 
        It should also be said that not all of the Garamond’s in the world are the same. Some are modern interpretations, sometimes others are recreations of typefaces from the late 1500’s modeled after the original punches. There are a few are faithful modern recreations based on the original punches.
